          <h3> Year Built </h3>

          <h3> Introduction </h3>
          <p> The Univeristy of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) is one of the largest university museums in the nation. Originally built as a memorial hall for
              fallen alumni in the Civil War and a place to house the university's art collections, the building has now expanded greatly and holds nearly 19,000 works of art.</p>
          <p> In addition to its large collection of artwork, UMMA holds events and different expositions throughout the year. For example, they sometimes host events
          known as Student Late Nights, which include activities such as collaborative art making, silent discos, music mixing, and free food. The continuous hostings of
          new expositions, such as the current "Art in The Age of The Internet, 1989 to Today" also keep things fresh for visitors. </p>
